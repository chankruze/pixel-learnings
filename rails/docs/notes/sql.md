### count vs length vs size

So if you had noticed, in one of the iterations of our set_slug method, we had used size method like this count = Task.where("slug LIKE ?", "#{title_slug}%").size. But why exactly did we use it over count and length? It's pretty straightforward:

1. `count`: This method determines the number of elements with an SQL COUNT query. If you do not have anything loaded in the memory, use count to make a query on database.
1. `length`: This method simply loads the data of the association into the memory and then returns the number of elements loaded.
1. `size`: This method works as a combination of both the above mentioned methods i.e. if the collection has already been loaded in the memory, it will return the length same as calling length. If it has not been loaded yet, it is like calling count.

So in most cases size does the job.
